### **Game Design Document (GDD): DeepvoidGate**

**Genre**: Browser-Based Space Idle/Management Game
**Platform**: Browser, possibly mobile.
**Goal**: Combine deep grinding, strategic colony management, and a survival atmosphere without a prestige reset system.

---

### **1. General Overview**

* **Story**: Humanity colonizes the last habitable planet, **New Hope**, after Earth’s destruction. The player manages resources, population, and technology to rebuild civilization and explore space.
* **Key Themes**: Survival, ethical choices, exploration, long-term investment.
* **Tone**: Dark sci-fi with a hint of hope (e.g., holographic memories of Earth).

---

### **2. Core Mechanics**

#### **Resources**

1. **Basic**:

   * **Oxygen (O₂)**: Keeps the population alive. Produced by generators.
   * **Food**: Grown in hydroponic farms.
   * **Energy**: From solar/geothermal reactors.
   * **Metals**: Mined from asteroids and planets.
   * **Science**: Generated by laboratories, unlocks technologies.

2. **Population**:

   * **Workers**: Assigned to buildings to maintain 100% efficiency.
   * **Max population**: Increased by building shelters.

#### **Worker System**

* Each building has a **required number of workers** (e.g., mine: 5).
* **Efficiency**: `min(1, assigned_workers / required_workers)`.
* **Shortage Penalties**:

  * <100% workers → efficiency drops (e.g., 3/5 → 60%).
  * Prolonged shortage → malfunctions (–20% efficiency).

#### **Buildings and Production**

* **Example Buildings**:

  | **Name**            | **Function**    | **Cost** (formula)                  |
  | ------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
  | O₂ Generator        | Produces oxygen | `100 * 1.6ⁿ metals + 20n energy`    |
  | Metal Mine          | Extracts metals | `50 * 1.8ⁿ metals + 10 * 2ⁿ energy` |
  | Holographic Theater | Boosts morale   | `200 metals + 50 energy`            |

* **Global Bonuses**: Every purchased building gives a permanent +0.1% boost to that resource’s production.

### **3. Progression and Endgame**

#### **Eternal Goals**

* **Megastructures**:

  | **Name**     | **Effect**          | **Cost**                  |
  | ------------ | ------------------- | ------------------------- |
  | Dyson Sphere | +50% energy forever | 1e18 Energy + 1e15 Metals |
  | The Ark      | Unlock new planets  | 5e16 Science              |

#### **Technologies**

* Tech tree with **multiplicative bonuses** (e.g., +20% farm efficiency).
* **Example branches**:

  * **Automation**: Reduces required workers by 10% per level.
  * **Colonization**: Unlocks new planets with unique resources.

#### **Morale**

* Affects **maximum building efficiency** and chances for **critical production**.
* **Increased by**:

  * Cultural buildings (theaters, stadiums).
  * Events (concerts, holidays).

### **4. Events and Challenges**

* **Random events** (every 15–60 minutes):

  | **Type**      | **Effect**                                             |
  | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
  | Solar Storm   | +200% energy, –50% O₂ for 1 hour                       |
  | Pirate Attack | Steals 20% metals, but +5% to defense stats            |
  | Epidemic      | Choose: quarantine (–30% production) or risk spreading |

### **5. Visual Layer and UI**

* **Art Style**:

  * **Planet**: Dark, industrial habitats with neon accents.
  * **Space**: Minimalist, procedurally generated stars/planets.
* **Interface**:

  * **Main Panel**: Building list with efficiency bars and assigned workers.
  * **Galaxy Map**: Clickable planets/asteroids with resource info.
  * **Graphs**: For hardcore players (e.g., O₂ production over time).

---

### **6. Monetization and Community**

* **Cosmetics**: Building skins (e.g., “Retro-Earth”) for real money.
* **Co-op**: Joint projects with other players (e.g., building a hyperspace bridge).
* **Ethical DLC**: Story expansions (e.g., “AI Rights” with new dilemmas).

---

### [**7. Roadmap**](/docs/roadmap.md)

---

### **Summary**

This GDD focuses on:

* **Deep grinding** without resets, with permanent goals.
* **Strategic management** of workers and morale.
* **Atmospheric narrative** about humanity’s last colony.
