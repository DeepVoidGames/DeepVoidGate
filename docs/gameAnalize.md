# DeepvoidGate Game Mechanics Analysis

DeepvoidGate appears to be a space colony management simulation game with multiple interconnected systems. Based on the screenshots provided, here's an analysis of the main game mechanics:

## Core Management Systems

### Colony Management

- **Population System**: The colony has a population counter (currently at 370) with new colonists arriving at timed intervals.
- **Buildings Management**: Players can construct and manage multiple facility types organized under categories (Production, Research, Housing, Storage).
- **Resource Network**: Six primary resources are tracked: Oxygen, Water, Food, Energy, Metals, and Science, each with production rates and storage capacity.

### Resource Production

- **Production Buildings**: Various production facilities can be constructed for resource generation.
- **Worker Assignment**: Buildings require worker allocation for operation (e.g., "4/5 workers" showing assigned/maximum).
- **Building Efficiency**: All production facilities show an efficiency percentage (100% in most examples).
- **Resource Inputs/Outputs**: Buildings consume certain resources to produce others (e.g., oxygen production may require energy input).

### Technology System

- **Research Tree**: Organized into categories (Infrastructure, Energy, Production, Research, Advanced).
- **Technology Dependencies**: Some technologies require prerequisites to be researched first.
- **Technology Effects**: Research unlocks new building types, improvements, or special abilities.
- **Research Status**: Technologies can be displayed with a "Researched" status.
- **Advanced Researchs**: This type of technologies unlock new content/mechanics.

### Milestone System

- **Progress Tracking**: Shows completion status (e.g., "37/60 (61.7%) completed").
- **Categorized Goals**: Milestones are organized by type (Resources, Buildings, Population, Technology, Expeditions, Artifacts).
- **Tiered Objectives**: Each major category has multiple tiers with specific objectives (e.g., "Oxygen Collector V" requiring 10,000,000 oxygen collection).
- **Progress Visualization**: Progress bars show completion percentage toward each milestone goal.

### Expedition System

- **Mission Types**: Different expedition types available (Scientific, Mining) with unique rewards.
- **Difficulty Selection**: Missions have selectable difficulty levels (0-10 scale).
- **Crew Management**: Expeditions require crew allocation with limited availability.
- **Duration Management**: Expeditions have set durations (e.g., 21:00 minutes).
- **Random Events**: Expeditions can trigger events requiring player decisions (e.g., "Forgotten Fungal Culture" with options to study or harvest).
- **Risk/Reward Mechanics**: Some options offer tradeoffs (e.g., "Accelerate through dangerous zone (50% gain/lose)").
- **Connection with Technologies**: Scientific expedition has chance to unlock new technologie exercise to expedition.
- **Connection with Artifacts**: Mining expedition has chance to unlock/add copy of artifact specific for expedition level.

### Faction System

- **Multiple Factions**: Three factions exist (Technocrat Syndicate, Biogenesis Coalition, Order of Stellar Understanding).
- **Loyalty Mechanics**: Player can build loyalty with factions (e.g., "5020/10000").
- **Hostility Tracking**: Potential for negative relations with factions (Didn't implemented yet).
- **Faction Bonuses**: At specific loyalty thresholds (1K+, 5K+), special bonuses become available.
- **Unique Specializations**: Each faction has thematic specializations (e.g., Technocrats focus on "Production optimization, automation, AI").

### Artifact System

- **Collectible Items**: Rare artifacts with special properties (Gravity Artifact, Quantum Cube, Time Crystal).
- **Rarity System**: Artifacts have quality ratings (5-star ratings shown).
- **Power Scaling**: Artifacts can be upgraded through tiers.
- **Bonus Effects**: Each provides unique bonuses (e.g., "Increases production of all resources by 60%").
- **Acquisition Method**: Can be found during expeditions.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Upgrade Systems

- **Building Tiers**: Buildings can be upgraded through multiple tiers (shown as "Max Tier Reached" for completed buildings).
- **Upgrade Progress**: Visible progress tracking for ongoing upgrades ("10/10 upgrades" after 10/10 next upgrade adding +1 to tier if not max tier).
- **Resource Production Scaling**: Higher-tier buildings have improved production rates.

### Worker Management

- **Limited Workforce**: System shows "9/530 workers available" indicating a limited resource.
- **Assignment Strategy**: Players must allocate workers strategically among buildings.
- **Worker Efficiency**: More workers generally increase production capacity.

### Strategic Decision Making

- **Resource Balancing**: Need to balance production and consumption of interconnected resources.
- **Expedition Risk Assessment**: Deciding between different mission types and difficulty levels.
- **Faction Alignment**: Choosing which factions to build loyalty with for different bonuses.
- **Technology Prioritization**: Selecting research paths that align with colony needs.

### Progression Systems

- **Technology Tree Expansion**: Researching technologies enables access to buildings and unlocks new gameplay options.
- **Artifact Collection**: Finding and upgrading artifacts provides significant boosts.
- **Faction Reputation**: Building loyalty unlocks special bonuses and new buildings.

### User Interface Systems

- **Tabbed Navigation**: Multiple interface sections (Home, Tech, Milestones, Hub).
- **Filtering Options**: Ability to hide researched technologies or search for specific items.
- **Resource Visualization**: Color-coded resource bars with rate indicators.
- **Planetary View**: Visual representation of the colony planet.

This appears to be a complex strategy simulation game focused on resource management, technological advancement, and strategic decision-making in a space colony setting, with multiple interlocking systems that create depth and replayability.
